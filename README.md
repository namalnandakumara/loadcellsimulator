This is a basic C# .NET Windows Forms application. To open the software, start with the “Comapp” I provided in the ZIP file. The application includes several operations. When you click the "Basic" button, a new window opens where you can connect to a port. You can use buttons to connect or disconnect from the port.
 I also provided additional interfaces for knob control and axle simulation.

 Use Visual Studio to develop this app. Create separate windows individually, and then connect all the windows to one main interface. This software works as I expected.
